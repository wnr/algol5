{GAME} is a simple game played on a board with 5Ã—5 squares.
The name is a portmanteau of Neutron and Teeko, two games on which it is based.

Neutreeko is a highly tactical game with little room for long-term strategic planning. But if neither side
has an attack coming up, it can often be a good idea to immobilize your opponent by forcing him into a corner.
